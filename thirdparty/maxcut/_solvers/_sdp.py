    Given a graph with non-negative weights, the method implemented

    where $X = (x_{{ij}}))$ is a positive semi-definite matrix with
    values equal to 1 on its diagonal.

    The implementation relies on an external solver, interfaced
    through the `cvxpy` package, thus allowing the user to select
    the precise solver to use (by default, 'scs').

    Usage:
    >>> sdp = MaxCutSDP(graph)
    >>> cut = sdp.get_solution('cut')          # solve problem here
    >>> cut_value = sdp.get_solution('value')  # get pre-computed solution
