    """Bureir-Monteiro approach solver for the Max-Cut problem.

    Given a graph with non-negative weights, the method implemented
    here aims at minimizing $$<CY, Y>$$, where C denotes the adjacency
    matrix of the graph and $Y$ is a matrix of dimensions (n, p) so
    that each of its rows is of unit norm.

    The implementation relies on a Riemannian Trust-Region algorithm,
    which itself relies on a truncated conjugate gradient method to
    iteratively solve and adjust trust-region subproblems in order
    to converge towards a global minimizer.

    Usage:
    >>> bm = MaxCutBM(graph)
    >>> cut = bm.get_solution('cut')          # solve problem here
    >>> cut_value = bm.get_solution('value')  # get pre-computed solution

    See the documentation of classes RiemannianTrustRegion and
    TruncatedConjugateGradient for more details and references.
